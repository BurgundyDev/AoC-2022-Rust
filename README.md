# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions in Rust
These are my solutuions for 2022 Advent of Code problems, built entirely in Rust.

All days are set up as separate cargo projects in their own DayXX folders.

This is my first shot at both AoC and Rust so comments, improvements, suggestions are very much welcome both as pull requests, issues and messages.

This is my main attempt, but I will also be [attempting these problems in Kotlin](https://github.com/BurgundyDev/AoC-2022-Kotlin) if I have the time.
